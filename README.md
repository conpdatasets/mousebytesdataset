# MouseBytes Data:

MouseBytes (https://mousebytes.ca/home) is an open-access high-throughput pipeline and database for rodent touchscreen-based cognitive assessment. You can find cognitive behavioral datasets from different animal disease models and cognitive tasks, here. Note that only public datasets in MouseBytes can be shared and re-used under CC0 License. 

Each folder belongs to a dataset, and it has its own README file describing metadata associate to all the data files in the dataset. Trial-by-trial data and aggregated data were provided for each dataset in the corresponding folder.

If you are interested in specific data, you can query it using this link: https://mousebytes.ca/data-extraction

### Dataset 1 (Weston-Project): "Alzheimer’s mouse models dataset"

This dataset has data files from 5-Choice, Pairwise Visual Discrimination (PVD), and Paired-Associates Learning (PAL) cognitive behavioral tasks in which male and female mice from 3 Alzheimer’s mouse models (3xTG-AD, 5XFAD, APP/PS1) were tested using touchscreen technology at two different sites (e.g. University of Western Ontario and University of Guelph). Both aggregated data and trial-by-trial data are provided in this dataset.

### Dataset 2 (Cholinergic-deficient-mouse-model): "Brainstem cholinergic-deficient mouse model (VAChT^En1-Cre-flox/flox) dataset"

Male mice and their wild-type controls were evaluated at 11-13 months of age to assess discrimination learning and cognitive flexibility using Pairwise visual discrimination (PVD) task and to assess learning and memory deficits using Pairwise Associate Learning (PAL) task. Male mice and their wild-type controls were also evaluated at 7-10 months of age using 5-Choice Serial Reaction Time (5-CSRT) task for assessing attention deficits.
*An extinction task is also present - research purposes TBA*
