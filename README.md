# MouseBytes Data:

MouseBytes (https://mousebytes.ca/home) is an open-access high-throughput pipeline and database for rodent touchscreen-based cognitive assessment. You can find cognitive behavioral datasets from different animal disease models and cognitive tasks, here. Note that only public datasets in MouseBytes can be shared and re-used under CC0 License. 

Each folder belongs to a dataset, and it has its own README file describing metadata associate to all the data files in the dataset. Trial-by-trial data and aggregated data were provided for each dataset in the corresponding folder.

If you are interested in specific data, you can query it using this link: https://mousebytes.ca/data-extraction

### Dataset 1 (Weston-Project): "Alzheimer’s mouse models dataset"

This dataset has data files from 5-Choice, Pairwise Visual Discrimination (PVD), and Paired-Associates Learning (PAL) cognitive behavioral tasks in which male and female mice from 3 Alzheimer’s mouse models (3xTG-AD, 5XFAD, APP/PS1) were tested using touchscreen technology at two different sites (e.g. University of Western Ontario and University of Guelph). Both aggregated data and trial-by-trial data are provided in this dataset.

### Dataset 2 (Cholinergic-deficient-mouse-model): "Brainstem cholinergic-deficient mouse model (VAChT^En1-Cre-flox/flox) dataset"

Male mice and their wild-type controls were evaluated at 7-10 months of age using the 5-Choice Serial Reaction Time (5-CSRT) task to assess attention. Immediately after (approximately at 9-12 months of age) these same mice were evaluated using the Extinction task to assess their ability to extinguish a response. A different cohort of male mice and their wild-type controls were evaluated at 11-13 months of age in the Pairwise visual discrimination (PVD) task to assess discrimination and reversal learning. Immediately after (still within 11-13 months of age) these same mice were evaluated using the Pairwise Associate Learning (PAL) task to assess learning and memory.

### Dataset 3: (Co-transmission-of-cholinergic-interneurons): "Mouse models that differ in neurotransmitter release from striatal cholinergic interneurons"


This dataset has data files from 5-Choice Serial Reaction Time (5-CSRT), Pairwise Visual Discrimination (PVD), and Extinction cognitive behavioral tasks for 4 mouse lines that differ in neurotransmitter release from striatal cholinergic interneurons (ACh or Glu). D2CreVGLUT3fx and ChATIRESVGLUT3fx mice and their wild-type controls were evaluated at 3-7 months of age in the PVD task to assess discrimination and reversal learning. Immediately after (still within 3-7 months of age) these same mice were evaluated using the Extinction task to assess their ability to extinguish a response. D2CreVAChTfx mice and their wild-type controls were evaluated at 5-7 months of age in the 5-CSRT task to assess attention. Immediately after (still within 3-7 months of age) these same mice were evaluated using the Extinction task. VAChTfx control mice that were virally injected with GFP or Cre in the dorsal striatum were evaluated at 6-12 months in the PVD task, followed by the 5-CSRT task (approximately at 8-14 months of age).
